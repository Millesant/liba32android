# Next Work

The M3 loader + structural dynamic-array baseline is green on `bleeding` through PR #11 / commit `ac008b2d2a3158ffa4cb285e88cfabacea2ca4a2`. Future feature-scale work uses the repository's current requirements -> design -> tasks structure.

1. `003-elf32-dependency-resolution` — run the final exact-head T005 CI gate.
   - Status: T001 PASS (#112), T002 PASS (#116), T003 PASS (#118), T004 DONE. Architecture/README/spec/state are converged; final exact-head CI is NOT RUN.
   - Current action: let GitHub Actions validate the converged branch head without adding new feature scope.
   - DoD: Linux build + all CTest cases including `elf32_dependency_resolution` and `elf32_real_dependency_resolution` PASS, reproducible ARM32 fixture generation PASS, exact `liba32android.so` naming PASS, and Android `arm64-v8a` cross-build PASS on the exact T004 head.
   - After PASS: mark T005 DONE, verify PR #17 remains mergeable on the exact green head, then prepare it for merge. Do not start guest-placement/link-map work on this branch.
   - Termux: no device run is required for `003`; this feature stops at host-side dependency image acquisition.

2. Collect actual 16 KiB Android host-page evidence when an appropriate device/runner is available.
   - Goal: validate `MappedGuestMemory` and, if practical, the real 16 KiB-aligned ARM32 fixture on a runtime reporting 16384-byte pages.
   - Depends on: access to a suitable Android/AArch64 environment.
   - Relevant: `tools/android_address_space_probe.cpp`, `tools/android_runtime_smoke.cpp`, mapped-memory diagnostics/evidence docs.
   - DoD: executed device evidence is recorded with environment metadata; until then the status remains NOT RUN rather than inferred from ELF `p_align`.

3. Correct standalone address-space probe environment metadata.
   - Goal: distinguish compile-time NDK API from runtime Android SDK/release consistently with `android_runtime_smoke`.
   - Depends on: none.
   - Relevant: `tools/android_address_space_probe.cpp`, `tools/android_runtime_smoke.cpp`, `docs/diagnostics.md`.
   - DoD: output names no longer label compile-time API as runtime API; cross-build PASS; docs updated.

4. Add the next focused CPU regressions independently of linker work.
   - Goal: cover remaining high-value A32 seam behavior before more runtime layers depend on it.
   - Depends on: current CPU adapter/memory tests.
   - Relevant: `tests/cpu_execution.cpp` and neighboring CPU tests.
   - Scope: Thumb branch/call, Thumb memory/stack, targeted exception and invalid-code/memory behavior.
   - DoD: focused regressions PASS on the host suite and preserve Android cross-build.

5. Collect at least one materially different Android/vendor/kernel sample before making broad fastmem compatibility claims.
   - Goal: separate implementation confidence from single-device environmental evidence.
   - Depends on: access to another Android/AArch64 environment.
   - DoD: environment + reservation/fastmem/fallback observations are recorded as executed evidence.

6. Add a dedicated safe crash-test mode before deliberately exercising fatal crash diagnostics.
   - Goal: validate fatal diagnostics without turning ordinary probes into destructive tests.
   - Depends on: explicit isolated crash-test entry point.
   - DoD: crash behavior is opt-in, reproducible, documented, and cannot be triggered by normal smoke execution.

7. Decide the project's own open-source license before public release.
   - Goal: make project redistribution terms explicit while retaining dependency-license auditability.
   - Depends on: maintainer choice.
   - DoD: license file and README/dependency notices are consistent.
